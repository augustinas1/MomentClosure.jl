Given a *nonlinear* [`ReactionSystem`](https://catalyst.sciml.ai/stable/api/catalyst_api/#ModelingToolkit.ReactionSystem)
and an equivalent *linear* `ReactionSystem`, perform the Linear Mapping Approximation (LMA)
and return the corresponding linear [`RawMomentEquations`](@ref) of the system as well as
a Dictionary of reaction parameter substitutions obtained using LMA that are used to generate
the moment equations. See the [LMA theory section](@ref linear_mapping_approximation) for more details.

Notes:
- `rn_nonlinear` and `rn_linear` must be *identical* in layout in order to be interpreted correctly, and the
  nonlinear reactions contained in `rn_nonlinear` must all be linearised in `rn_linear` with rate coefficients
  updated accordingly. Although this requires a lot of manual input, automating the linearisation further is
  difficult due to arbitrary choices that may be mane in constructing the reaction networks.
- `binary_vars` *must* be specified for conditional closures as an array of indices of all species
  (as in [`Catalyst.speciesmap`](https://catalyst.sciml.ai/stable/api/catalyst_api/#Catalyst.speciesmap)) 
  which molecule number is a Bernoulli variable. Note that `rn_nonlinear`
  and `rn_linear` may internally order the species differently: `binary_vars` must be consistent with
  the ordering in the *nonlinear* network.
- By default the moment equations will be generated up to the order determined by the degree of nonlinearity
  of the nonlinear system's reactions. However, if higher order moment information is required, the optional
  `m_order` argument may be provided to increase the expansion order manually.
- `combinatoric_ratelaws=true` uses binomials in calculating the propensity functions
  of a `ReactionSystem`, see the notes for [`ModelingToolkit.jumpratelaw`]
  (https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/systems/ReactionSystem/#ModelingToolkit.jumpratelaw).
