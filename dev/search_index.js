The LMA is restricted in its applicability to chemical reaction networks where one of the substrates in each nonlinear reaction is a molecular species which copy number can be either zero or one (a Bernoulli/binary random variable). Note that a network can contain an arbitrary number of such species but more than one of them cannot be involved in any nonlinear reaction.

One could say that such formulation makes a stronger assumption about the underlying distribution and does not utilise all the information available about the system—our implementation takes that into account. For example, in case of m=3 q=4 moment expansion, we approximate the fourth order central moments in terms of third and lower order moments, whereas MEANS would approximate it using only first and second order moments. Curiously, MEANS formulation appears to be more numerically stable (shows weaker oscillations) at longer times in this particular case, as can be seen from the plots above.

Proceeding further to obtain an approximate time-dependent probability distribution of the nonlinear network is more involved as only a handful of closed-form solutions of linear networks are known. Moreover, simply computing the solutions can be a challenge due to their complicated analytical form. For these reasons, MomentClosure does not provide an automated approach to computing the probability distributions of the relevant nonlinear systems using LMA—these steps have to performed manually on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, below we demonstrate how this could be done for the nonlinear GRN we have been considering so far.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/LMA_example/#References","page":"LMA Example","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorials/LMA_example/","page":"LMA Example","title":"LMA Example","text":"[1]: Z.

However, in certain cases the reaction product may itself be a stochastic variable so that the corresponding expectation values, langle S_r^mathbfi-mathbfj rangle, must be taken into account. We have implemented a limited support for such systems where components of S can be independent geometrically distributed variables, see the specific gene network example.\nGeneration of raw moment equations is only possible if the kinetics of the system at hand are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn, otherwise the expectation value terms langle a_r(mathbfn) rangle and langle n_i_1^j_1 dotsm n_i_N^j_N a_r(mathbfn) rangle are ill-defined. This key issue can be overcome by the general central moment expansion method presented below.\nThe order of the polynomials a_r(mathbfn) determines the order of moments encountered in the generated system of ODEs. If the system is linear (contains only zeroth and first order reactions), the m^textth order moments will depend only of moments of order m or lower, hence constituting a finite hierarchy of moment ODEs that can be readily solved numerically or otherwise without approximations. However, if the system is non-linear (involves second or higher order reactions), moment equations will depend on higher order moments. For example, if the reaction network contains bimolecular reactions, the corresponding propensity functions will be second order polynomials and hence m^textth order moment equations will now depend on (m+1)^th order moments. This leads to an infinite hierarchy of coupled moment equations where each moment will depend on higher order moments—it cannot be solved directly and needs to be truncated. This can be achieved using one of many moment closure approximations that express (m+1)^textth order moments in terms of m^textth and lower order moments using different distributional assumptions, effectively closing the hierarchy and enabling one to solve the moment equations up to m^textth order [1]. Details of all closure methods currently implemented within the package can be found in the next Theory section.","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/moment_expansion/#central_moment_eqs","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Central Moment Equations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/moment_expansion/","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Moment Expansion","text":"As we have seen, the moment equations of P(mathbfn t) can be obtained in a straightforward manner if the kinetics of the system are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn [1].

This can nevertheless be overcome by considering a more general method of moment expansion that enables us to obtain mean and central moment equations up to arbitrary order for virtually any chemical reaction network with any type of smooth (infinitely differentiable) propensity functions.

As in Catalyst, the model specification is based on the rich symbolic-numeric modelling framework provided by ModelingToolkit.jl. Note that we have to explicitly define the molecule numbers of each chemical species as Symbolics.@variables and reaction constants as ModelingToolkit.@parameters. The time, t, must also be initialised as a ModelingToolkit.parameter and used to indicate the time-dependence of species' molecule numbers.
