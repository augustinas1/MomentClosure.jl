However, in certain cases the reaction product may itself be a stochastic variable so that the corresponding expectation values, langle S_r^mathbfi-mathbfj rangle, must be taken into account. We have implemented a limited support for such systems where components of S can be independent geometrically distributed variables, see the specific gene network example (FIX LINK).\nGeneration of raw moment equations is only possible if the kinetics of the system at hand are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn, otherwise the expectation value terms langle a_r(mathbfn) rangle and langle n_i_1^j_1 dotsm n_i_N^j_N a_r(mathbfn) rangle are ill-defined. This key issue can be overcome by the general central moment expansion method presented below.\nThe order of the polynomials a_r(mathbfn) determines the order of moments encountered in the generated system of ODEs. If the system is linear (contains only zeroth and first order reactions), the m^textth order moments will depend only of moments of order m or lower, hence constituting a finite hierarchy of moment ODEs that can be readily solved numerically or otherwise without approximations. However, if the system is non-linear (involves second or higher order reactions), moment equations will depend on higher order moments. For example, if the reaction network contains bimolecular reactions, the corresponding propensity functions will be second order polynomials and hence m^textth order moment equations will now depend on (m+1)^th order moments. This leads to an infinite hierarchy of coupled moment equations where each moment will depend on higher order moments—it cannot be solved directly and needs to be truncated. This can be achieved using one of many moment closure approximations that express (m+1)^textth order moments in terms of m^textth and lower order moments using different distributional assumptions, effectively closing the hierarchy and enabling one to solve the moment equations up to m^textth order [1]. Details of all closure methods currently implemented within package can be found in (FIX LINK).","category":"page"},{"location":"theory/moment_equations/#Central-moment-equations","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Central moment equations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"theory/moment_equations/","page":"Moment Expansion","title":"Moment Expansion","text":"As we have seen, the moment equations of P(mathbfn t) can be obtained in a straightforward manner if the kinetics of the system are governed by the law of mass action where all propensity functions are polynomials in mathbfn [1]. Similarly, given all propensities are rational functions, a polynomial form can also be recovered [2]. However, problems arise when the propensities take more complicated non-polynomial functions. This can nevertheless be overcome by considering a more general method of moment expansion that enables us to obtain mean and central moment equations up to arbitrary order for virtually any chemical reaction network with any type of smooth (infinitely differentiable) propensity functions. Such framework was first independently formulated by Lee [3] and Ale et al.
